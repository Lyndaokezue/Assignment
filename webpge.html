                    My name is <b>Okezue, Chioma Lynda</b>. I hail from Nigeria. People often call me Oma,
                    Lynda, Okezue, and a few Rita. I choose to go by the name Lynda because of the 
                    difficulty of those who are not from my tribe encounter while pronouncing my name but
                    lowkey I want to be addressed with Chioma.

                    My ALTSCHOOL ID number is <strong>ALT/SOE/023/2697.</strong>

                <h2>
                    MY BIOGRAPHY
                </h2>
                <p>
                    I was born in the city of Onitsha which is situated in Anambra state but I'm from Abia 
                    state. I am the third of five children and the second female  my family. I graduated
                    from UNIZIK this year, ofcourse, it would have been 2022 but ASUU strike happened to us
                    (second class upper) with a Bachelor"s degree in Zoology. I have always been a 
                    lover of technology as I have always loved calculations and i felt calculation was the 
                    beginning and end of technology. Well, if I hadn't studied zoology, i would have studie
                    mathmatics and guess what, the universe has it's way of pleasant surprises. I think
                     the word technology dawned on me sometime ago in secondary school when they made it 
                    compulsory that every SS3 student must own a PC, which the brand name was Hp and it 
                    ran on windows, i think windows 7. At that time, I would always watch movies and 
                    comic videos with it and also a little bit of corel draw to do graphics design and 
                    how to use microsoft excel, microsoft word and power point presentation and i was 
                    always feeling myself because i always believed i was doing a good job. 
                    <br><br>
                    Sometime in 2020, the year of COVID-19 pandemic and also the year of Academic Staff 
                    Union of Universities(ASUU) embarked on 9 months strike, it was one of the most 
                    difficult years of my life because I had to stay at home doing nothing with no actual
                     job. I started surfing the net and i saw a lot of technology related topics and how
                    the world kept moving as a result of technology. I decided to give technology a 
                    chance again.
                    <br>
                    <!--Reason for choosing to go for tech-->
                    <h3>
                        Here are my Why
                    </h3> 
                    I have always loved being able to solve complex problems by extracting insights and 
                    being able to break the problem bit by bit and solve the problem and now the best 
                    part with technology.

                    THE PATH TO ALTSCHOOL: UNDERSTANDING THE MOTIVATION WITHIN
                </h2>
                <P>
                    This new path and adventure is fueled by my passion for technology and hence, 
                    my reason for applying to ALT School Africa as I have heard a lot of good review. 
                    Hence, this is the begining of new chapter, new hope and the one I believe will make
                    me the best Cloud Engineer. This diploma program will accelerate my career by giving
                    me a structured learning path especially in this days of information overload, 
                    the little learning I have done has given me guidance and a step ahead. I also 
                    believe that it will improve my approach to solving problem and my thought process by
                    giving me valuable insights in all things related to cloud engineering. I strongly 
                    believe in networking and I have always believed that ALTSCHOOL will help me network
                    with like minds who can help me in terms of difficulties and people who can share 
                    knowledge with and relate with my peers who can quicken my learning.
                </P>

    <p>Here is my favourite Igbo adage that has been guiding me and I firmly believe in </p>
    <blockquote>Onye kwe, Chi ya ekwe</blockquote>
    <p> This quote above talks about the idea that one's beliefs and actions are often in alignment with
        their destiny or fate, and that when you make a decision or take a particular path, it is 
        supported by a higher power or fate. It underscores the idea of personal responsibility and the 
        connection between one's choices and their outcomes.</p>
    <p>Thank you for jounerying with me and I can't wait to share my beautiful adventure with you.</p>
